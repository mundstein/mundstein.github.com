At a recent panel discussion, I said this:

> Your money belongs to you, but yet you have to pay taxes.
> 
> Your body belongs to you, but some of us are obliged to do military service.
> 
> Your health data belongs to you, but aggregated and anonymised health data is a public good.

It seemed that most people in the audience wanted to applaud but felt constrained by the privacy watchdogs in the room. The fact is: most people are still paranoid when it comes to personal health data.

And quite justifiedly so. Do we really know what happens to the data that our trackers, smartphones and smartwatches load up to the cloud? How safe is it? Who owns it? Who uses it, and for what purposes?
